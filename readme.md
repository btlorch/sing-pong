## Notes

* Only works on linux and maybe OS X
* YOU MUST run 'python ./show_input_devices.py' and note the indices of one or two valid input devices (they must have input channels, the last number in each item)
* Use the above mentioned indices as arguments to the game, i.e.: 'python ./game.py -1 <first input index> -2 <second input index>'
